# CS2-Assignment-1-with-Report

Class Car:
To take in CarBrand/type/plate and speed
Has getters to get car speed and type
and setter to change any variable I want


Class Road:
To create Road with A, B, and C type each with different properties such as speed limit and specific access depending on the car type from the car class
Also has setters and getters for all variable for easy edits

Functions:

Created a function called car maker to auto create the dequeue process for the cars with the details i give which makes it easier to add any car I want to the dequeue process 
after I create it as an OBJ and add it to the queue 
furthermore, I tried to create a similar function in which it queues the car but it kept on causing an error

Int main:

Created 3 roads
Road A name: Highway, only allows Private vehicles and motorcycles and has a speed limit of 120
Road B name: Autobahn, allows all vehicles and basically has no speed limit
Road C name: HighwayT allows only trucks and has a speed limit of 100

Created 20 vehicles [10 Private, 5 motorcycles, & 5 Trucks]

Only used 10 for simplicity reasons but all are functional, and the code exists as a comment and can be used by removing the comment marking and changing the counter's initialized value

Queued all Cars
Then Used function car.maker to dequeue all cars with prompt to the user of whether to continue or not

Then after dequeuing all vehicles the efficiency test shows how efficient the road is and its vehicle count

Conclusion:
Everything works fine, and I feel that the user's input of whether you would want to continue or not, makes the output much smoother and easier to understand and follow through
